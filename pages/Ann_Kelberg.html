            Ann Kullberg had always been interested in art, but it wasn't until she saw a colored pencil picture that
            she found her medium. With the help of Bet Borgeson's book "The Colored Pencil" and a box of twenty-four
            pencils, Kullberg found her talent. Within a year she had won an award for her artwork.

            Kullberg draws portraits on commission in Oregon. She has also written two books describing her drawing
            techniques which she developed on her own. "Colored Pencil Portraits" and " Capturing Soft Realism in
            Colored Pencil" were both published by North Light Books. The artist has also created a monthly online
            magazine, "From My Perspective".
