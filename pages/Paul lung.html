            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Paul Lung is an internationally acclaimed photorealistic pencil artist who has practiced the art of the
                mechanical pencil for a decade. He sketches out a history of his career to Mark Yuen.
                He mostly enjoys doing these drawings of his pet because he feels that this subject is intimate to him
                and extremely dynamic. He is very right. It is amazing how real his drawings look and the fact that all
                he uses is a mechanical pencil is even more amazing. The fur on the cat is so dynamic.
                Hong Kong-based graphic designer doesn't even use an eraser in his beautiful drawings – all he needs is
                a 0.5 mm technical pencil, A2 paper and some time… Well, about 60 hours for just one of his black and
                white drawings.
                He was majorly influenced by Egon Schiele's quick sketches. He find his drawing special, particularly
                the use of distorted lines and colors. He take photos of the objects and draw them in pencil. He don't
                have a specific concept in his drawing, as he draw merely for personal enjoyment.
