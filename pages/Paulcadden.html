      Paul Cadden was born Glasgow, Scotland in 1964 and completed a BFA degree in Animation and
      Illustration at James Watt College in 2003, preceded by a four-year course in print design
      and illustration at Glasgow College of Building and Printing.His work is inspired by a
      fascination with the media, the way it manipulates audiences by favoring arguments in line
      with its own interests, and suppresses other points of view or simply diverts attention from them,
      resulting in to alienation and a prevailing cynicism among perceptive viewers.Cadden
      defines art as pouring personal subjectivity into an object in the hopes that other
      persons gains enjoyment from it. He says that allthough his drawings and paintings are
      based on photographs and video stills, they are softer and more complex, presenting the
      subject as a living tangible object. He renders objects and scenes meticulously, to create
      a reality not seen in the original photo.Hyper-realistic images place a great emphasis on
      details and subject. They are not direct translations of photographs or literal illustrations
      of a particular scene or subject. On the contrary, they portray a new element that the
      human eye could not detect in the original, in some cases because it did not exist.
      Cadden regards his paintings as a departure from classic Photo-realism, chiefly since
      they contain emotional, cultural and political themes without visual reference.His work
      has been exhibited in Glasgow including at the 149th Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine
      Arts Exhibition.
