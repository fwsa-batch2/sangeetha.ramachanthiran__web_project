                Diego Fazio aka DiegoKoi is an Italian artist from the town of Lamezia. Born in 1989, 
                the self-taught illustrator first started as a tattoo artist and says he was initially 
                inspired by the artwork of Katsushika Hokusai, a highly influential Japanese artist from 
                the Edo period.Diego only began drawing in 2007, yet his hyperrealistic pencil drawings 
                on paper and wood have garnered him international acclaim. Each portrait can take up to 
                200 hours but the results speak for themselves. At only 23-years of age, the future is 
                bright for this rising star. After tattoos he was drawn to hyperrealism, a concept in 
                philosophy and art that describes the hypothetical inability of consciousness to 
                distinguish reality from fantasy. His fascination was so great that he made him change 
                the thick lines of tattoos for the technical demands of hyper-realism.The first emotions 
                that his works produce in the viewer are a mixture of amazement, disbelief and admiration.
                His works are impressive for their realism and richness of details.
