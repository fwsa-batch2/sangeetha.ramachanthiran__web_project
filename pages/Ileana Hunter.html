                Ileana Hunter’s passion is drawing portraits of famous faces in a highly realistic style.
                She uses a variety of different pencils to create her drawings, ranging from hard pencils
                that create a light tone to soft lead pencils that creates rich, dark tones. The majority
                of Hunter’s models are female, including actresses like Scarlett Johansson and deceased singer
                Amy Winehouse. Using a photograph as reference, Hunter sketches and then shades her drawings,
                carefully copying the highlights, gradients and shadows of the photograph to create
                photorealistic drawings. “Photorealistic” means drawing or painting a picture that looks
                like a photograph but isn’t. It is a style that is tricky to achieve as it requires a lot
                of time and patience and doesn’t allow the artist to use expressive brushstrokes or pencil
                lines in the art work.Like many artists, Ileana Hunter is fascinated by human eyes
                and has created several photorealistic drawings that explore the minute details of the
                skin, eyelashes and irises that make up the human eye. In many of her realistic
                drawings of eyes, the reflection in the model’s eye tells a story of its own. In one
                pencil drawing, there is a silhouette of a human being looking into the eye, which
                gives the viewer the impression that it is themselves caught in reflection.Ileana Hunter’s art is
                classified as both fine art and fan art. It is fine art because her medium is pencil on paper, which is
                considered a fine art medium.
