            Monica Lee is an illustrator based in Malaysia. She draws mind blowing photo-realistic images
            simply with graphite pencils. She explains her work by saying, “I like to challenge myself
            with complex portraits especially people with freckles or beard.
            She is a photorealism artist and She have been drawing for about 5 years now. She's favourite
            subject to draw is wildlife and portraiture. She loves black and white photographs. Therefore,
            She use only charcoal and graphite pencils only.She Says 
            <b>"Nothing beats getting your hands dirty while drawing with a pencil".</b>
            Ever since She was a child, She loved to draw and wanted to become an artist. She attended a 
            local art college and majored in 3D animation. Before,She was really bad at drawing. 
            Therefore, She did not pursue a career in art. Instead, She worked as a digital imaging 
            artist in her dad’s advertising photography studio for 12 years. In 2013, She came across 
            some artworks on Instagram, and She was so inspired by it that She started drawing again 
            just for fun. She realized that She still love to draw. So, She quit her job and started her journey 
            as a full-time artist.Her parents were very supportive . Even She eventually decided to quit 
            her job to become a full-time artist, they supported her decision.The biggest challenge was 
            during the early stage of being an artist..
