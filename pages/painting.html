            Painting is the act or process of using paint. The paint can create an artwork known as a
            painting, or it can be used more practically as a protective coating or form of decoration.
            Paintings are a form of visual art that captures the expression of ideas and emotions on a
            two-dimensional surface.Painting also allows individuals a chance to express their feelings and 
            emotions without words. It can be tough opening up sometimes, so painting is a great way to release
            inner thoughts.
