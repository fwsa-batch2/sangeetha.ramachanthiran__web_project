                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A colored pencil, coloured pencil,pencil crayon, or coloured/colouring
                Canadian English,<span>Newfoundland English</span> is an art medium constructed of a narrow, pigmented core
                encased in a wooden
                cylindrical case.Water-soluble pencils and pastel pencils are also manufactured
                as well as colored cores for mechanical pencils.Colored pencils are made in a wide range of price,usability,
                from student-grade to professional-grade. Concentration of pigments in the quality and core, lightfastness of
                the
                pigments, durability of the colored pencil, and softness of the core are some determinants of a brand’s quality
                and
                its market price.
