        About
    </h1>
    <div id="content">
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Anna Hammer was born and raised in Poland. She graduated from the School of Fine Arts located in a beautiful
            town in the northeast of the country. She was always drawn to portraiture. Although She have worked with various
            media, colored pencil is by far her favorite. Since She spent most of her career doing portraits for commission,
            She was never able to amass a portfolio of originals, because they went to her customers. In order to build up
            a body of work, She started to make illustrations. She have been fortunate to have her now teenaged daughter as
            inspiration. It has been no less than fascinating observing her grow and transform into a beautiful,
            emotional and supremely complex young woman. Not surprisingly, she is her main model. When She was not busy with
            portraits of Olivia, She find herself easily falling into fashion illustrations. Among other things, these
            pieces help to fill the gaps and overcome any blocks or dry spells She experience from time to time. It also
            allows her to work with other media including ink and water color. She hope to continue exploring this style
            and expand on it, while still concentrating on portraits in pencil.
