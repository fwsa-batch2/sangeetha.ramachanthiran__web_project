        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Arlene Steinberg, CPSA, has been creating art. While still in high school she sold needlepoint designs to
            stores and manufacturers, and created a needlepoint cover for a trade magazine. Arlene continued her art
            studies at Syracuse University and went on to have a successful 20 year career as a textile and wallpaper
            designer. After leaving the textile industry, Arlene dabbled with different mediums before discovering
            colored pencils in 2000.

            Arleneâ€™s focus is on the color and light found in everyday objects. At first glance her work appears to be
            realism or photo-realism. Upon closer inspection, it becomes obvious Arlene accurately draws her objects,
            while manipulating color and light to transcend her art beyond realism. Using mostly Stonehenge paper,
            Arlene developed a technique of layering complementary colors to enrich her shadows. With multiple colors
            and numerous layers, she creates brilliant rich hues that have become her signature style.
