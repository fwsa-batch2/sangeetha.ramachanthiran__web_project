                Franco Clun is a self-taught artist from Italy known for his hyperrealistic portraits
                drawn with only a pencil. All of his works are done on watercolor paper and take upwards
                of 50 hours to complete. Clun tells the Daily Mail:<b> "I learn something new every time
                    I take a pencil in my hand."</b>
                Franco Clun is an Italian Artist that only uses pencil in this work,
                his art work involves incredibly realistic portraits that include famous people that
                are can be mistaken for photographs. Franco Clun has ever in this life studied art and
                still a great part of the art world.His detailed pencil drawings are amazing, the way he
                has captured the contrast of the light and dark areas and the natural lighting make the
                drawings like a black and white photographs.
                The picture says how much he love drawing and he love the graphite
                <b>(also said I have an ugly face, but you are kind and pretend not to notice)</b>
                He always had overwhelming passions, and the drawing is one of them.For a long time
                He have left to devote to other things, but He returned three years ago.Unfortunately He
                did not study art, and everything He know and learned from experience and from reading
                some drawing manuals.
