                Born 1st November 1985 in London, UK. Studied a Foundation course in Art & Design at City
                & Guilds Art School and a graduate from Middlesex University with a B.A. (Hon)s in Fine
                Art.From as early as he could remember, Kelvin Okafor has always been an emotional and
                highly sensitive individual. Inspired, touched and captivated by almost everything in
                his immediate surroundings. Around the age of 8, Okafor vividly remembers having a
                love and strong fascination for drawing with pencils. He found the instrument to be a
                humble one and would often use the expression ‘aliveness’ to describe it’s technical
                and sentimental value. What fascinated him most about pencils was that with single
                shades of lead, he could create tones and textures so defined and so abstract, an
                illusion of colour would be formed before him. He became heavily inspired by this
                notion and spent most of his early years trying to utilise its technical use.The style
                in which Okafor creates his portraits is known as Hyper-realism. Art Critic, Estelle Lovatt
                describes his work as ‘Emotional Realism’.How the work of Okafor goes beyond
                being just ‘Photorealist’ drawings, and instead coins the term Emotional Realism to
                describe the affective nature of his artwork.<br>
                <strong>"I love to draw faces. Each face to me tells an intriguing story regardless of age, 
                gender, race or background."</strong>
